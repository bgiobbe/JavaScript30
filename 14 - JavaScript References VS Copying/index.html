    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Beth';

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log('Reference', players, team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team1 = [].concat(players);
    team1[3] = 'Susan';
    console.log('[].concat()]', players, team1);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = Array.from(players);
    team2[3] = 'Alex';
    console.log('Array.from()', players, team2);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players];
    team3[3] = 'Ralph';
    console.log('ES6 Spread', players, team3);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const human = person;
    human.age = 22;
    console.log('Object reference', person, human);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const friend = Object.assign({}, person);
    friend.age = 35;
    console.log('Object.assign', person, friend);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    friend.pets = ['Trixie', 'Twinkletoes'];
    friend2 = Object.assign({}, friend);
    friend2.pets.push('Gingersnap');
    console.log('Shallow copy', friend, friend2);
    
    // not efficient, but it works as deep copy
    friend3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(friend2));
    friend3.pets = ['GloryB'];
    console.log('JSON copy', friend2, friend3);
